# Lychen

Lychen is an environmental and agricultural symbiosis platform aiming to connect diverse actors across the local territory. Our platform brings together food producers, consumers, researchers, local communities, and other stakeholders in a collaborative space to foster sustainable agricultural practices and environmental initiatives.

## Overview

The platform serves as a digital hub for:

- **Food Production**: Centralizing agricultural resources and connecting producers with local distribution channels.
- **Food Consumption**: Educating and supporting consumers in making sustainable food choices.
- **Waste Valorization**: Providing resources and strategies for repurposing organic waste.
- **Local Activities**: Coordinating events, workshops, and community initiatives that strengthen the local ecosystem.

By promoting symbiotic relationships between these actors, Lychen encourages ecological and sustainable practices that support biodiversity, food security, and a resilient local economy.
