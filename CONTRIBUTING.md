Please take a moment to read the guidelines below before submitting your contribution.

## Install Proto

In order to install all you need you have to install [Proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto)
, Moonrepoâ€™s version manager, to ensure consistent toolchains across all environments. Follow the instruction at this link https://moonrepo.dev/docs/proto/install

Don't forget to setup your $PATH

```bash
export PROTO_HOME="$HOME/.proto"
export PATH="$PROTO_HOME/shims:$PROTO_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Then restart your terminal and verify the installation with:

```bash
proto --version
```

Proto automatically installs and manages the correct versions of node, yarn, moon, npm and other tools defined in .prototools. This ensures that everyone in the project uses the same setup, reducing build inconsistencies and environment issues.
